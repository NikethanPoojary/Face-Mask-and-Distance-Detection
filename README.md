Face Mask and Distance Detection
To avoid the spread of this virus, many measures have been suggested, such as maintaining a social distance, that is, maintaining a proper physical distance between people and lessening close contact with each other, and wearing a face mask to avoid the droplets from transmitting through the air. Therefore, this research paper focuses and aims its study towards implementing a Social Distancing and Face Mask Detection System. This system will implement object detection and facial recognition in the video footages of pedestrians. Pre-trained models such as the YOLOv3, ResNet Classifier and DSFD are used. People violating the minimum distance were detected as well as faces without face-masks were detected. An overall results board is displayed in the output containing the number of people violating or non-violating the respective measures.
